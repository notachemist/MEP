1976 CIELab Color Model is utilized.
2MEP targeting is for working with two MEPs and targeting by linear interpolation.
3MEP targeting is for working with three MEPs and targeting by barycentric coordinates in the 1976 CIELab space. 
  When working with 3 MEPs, only a* and b* axes are used. However, this can be extended to 4 MEPs which would then allow for utilization of the L* axis.
